I love code since 2009, while I'm in 9th grade. That year, my brother learns Pascal in his college and I copycat him to learn Pascal. Before I know [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), I learn Pascal from books and [Tutorial Points](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/pascal/index.htm).

Every programming language tutorial always starts with the project structure, basic syntax, variables and constants, data types, etc. I can understand the curriculum until I face Arrays.

At that time, I can't understand what is Array, what is Pointer, what is the purpose of this data type, how to use it, etc. I stop learn the curriculum and only create a simple program using basic syntaxes.

I create a simple program to calculate the area of 2D and 3D shapes, circle circumferences, the perimeter of shapes, and the volume of 3D shapes. I create this simple program to help me calculate my homework.

It should be easy to calculate it using a calculator directly. But, I love the interaction with my program. "What is the radius?", that is what the program said. When I input 7, it calculates and shows 154 as the area and 44 as the circumference. Even, at that time, I remember the area of a circle with a radius multiple of 7. 154, 616, 1386, and 2464 (a radius of 35 is rare to appear on the exam, hehe).

I started my college life in 2012 and I am frustrated while facing Array, especially in C. For the first-year final project, we asked to create a Hangman game, with Array and save-load features that serialize and deserialize the game's state to file. In my team, I am the only student who understands and loves serializing data to file. And also, I am the only student who didn't understand Array. I think this is good symbiosis.

On the first day of the second year, my lecturer teaches me about the curriculum of the first year, in 90 minutes session. With that, I can understand how Array and Pointers work in C. This 90 minutes session ruined my first year completely, hehe.

On this blog, I hope I can write and tell you about my code journey, from zero to hero.
