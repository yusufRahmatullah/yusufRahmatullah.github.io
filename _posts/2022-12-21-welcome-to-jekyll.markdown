Jekyll is a static site generator. It takes text written in your favorite markup language and uses layouts to create a static website. You can tweak the siteâ€™s look and feel, URLs, the data displayed on the page, and more.

Yeah, I co-pas that from this [Jekyl Ruby page](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/).

Every code starts with Hello World. Also, my blog starts with Hello, Jekyll.

Why I love to write in Markdown? Because I can insert code snippet here

```ruby
def code_snippet
  puts "Hello, Jekyll"
end
```

```python
def code_snippet():
  print("Hello, Jekyll")
```

And also, I can embed gist code here

{% gist a219a7dca80f12434d1b %}

{% gist 5555251 gist.md %}
